This repository contains the R scripts used to analyse the benthos data that were collected duing the 2017 and 2018 cruises in the framework of the Rijkswaterstaat project 'Natuurlijk Veilig'. The benthos was sampled and analysed in the laboratory by Wageningen Marine Research (responsible research Ralf van Hal). The data have been made available through Rijkswaterstaat.
Note that this repository does not contain the data nor the output, as storage on GitHub is not appropriate for that. Apply the R scripts in this repository in a local clone of the repository. Data are fetched from a server.
